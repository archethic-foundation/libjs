# ArchEthic SDK Javascript

Official ArchEthic Javascript library for Node and Browser.

## Installing

```bash
npm install archethic
```

## Usage

This library aims to provide a easy way to create ArchEthic transaction and to send them over the network.

It supports the ArchEthic Cryptography rules which are:

- Algorithm identification: keys are prepared by metadata bytes to indicate the curve used and the origin of the generation, and hashes are prepended by a byte to indicate the hash algorithm used. 
  Those information help during the verification

- Key derivation:
  
    To be able to retrieve previous public key, the ArchEthic network designs the key derivation through a seed (passphrase) and an index(number of
     previous public keys/transactions).
    The procedure is described as follows:
    
    ```
    The seed generates a master key and an entropy used in the child keys generation.

                                                               / (256 bytes) Next private key
                          (256 bytes) Master key  --> HMAC-512
                        /                              Key: Master entropy,
      seed --> HASH-512                                Data: Master key + index)
                        \
                         (256 bytes) Master entropy

    ```  
   
## API

  ### Cryptographic functions

  #### deriveKeyPair(seed, index, curve)

  It creates a new keypair into hexadecimal format

  - `seed` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the transaction chain seed to be able to derive and generate the keys
  - `index` is the number of transactions in the chain, to generate the actual and the next public key (see below the cryptography section)
  - `curve` is the elliptic curve to use for the key generation (can be "ed25519", "P256", "secp256k1") - default to: "P256"

  ```js
  const archethic = require("archethic")
  const { publicKey: publicKey, privateKey: privateKey} = archethic.deriveKeyPair("mysuperpassphraseorseed", 0)
  // publicKey => 0100048cac473e46edd109c3ef59eec22b9ece9f99a2d0dce1c4ccb31ce0bacec4a9ad246744889fb7c98ea75c0f0ecd60002c07fae92f23382669ca9aff1339f44216

  ### TransactionBuilding
  
  `newTransactionBuilder(type)` creates a new instance of the transaction builder
  
  `type` is the string defining the type of transaction to generate ("keychain", "keychain_access", "transfer", "hosting", "code_proposal", "code_approval", "nft")
  
  The transaction builder instance contains the following methods:
  
  #### setCode(code)
  Add the code in the `data.code` section of the transaction
  `code` is a string defining the smart contract
  
  #### setContent(content)
  Add the content in the `data.content` section of the transaction
  `content` is a string defining the smart contract
  
  #### addOwnership(secret, authorizedKeys)
  Add an ownership in the `data.ownerships` section of the transaction with a secret and its related authorized public keys to be able to decrypt it.
  This aims to prove the ownership or the delegatation of some secret to a given list of public keys.

  `secret` is the hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the encrypted secret
  `authorizedKeys` is a list of object represented by 
    - `publicKey` is the hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the public key
    - `encryptedSecretKey` is the hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the secret key encrypted with the public key (see `ecEncrypt`)
  
  #### addUCOTransfer(to, amount)
  Add a UCO transfer to the `data.ledger.uco.transfers` section of the transaction
  - `to` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the transaction address (recipient) to receive the funds
  - `amount` is the number of uco to send (float)

  #### addNFTTransfer(to, amount, nft_address)
  Add a NFT transfer to the `data.ledger.nft.transfers` section of the transaction
  - `to` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the transaction address (recipient) to receive the funds
  - `amount` is the number of uco to send (float)
  - `nft_address` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the NFT address to spend

  #### addRecipient(to)
  Add a recipient (for non UCO transfers, ie. smart contract interaction) to the `data.recipient` section of the transaction
  - `to` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the transaction address (recipient)
  
  #### build(seed, index, curve, hashAlgo)
  Generate `address`, `previousPublicKey`, `previousSignature`, `originSignature` of the transaction and 
  serialize it using a custom binary protocol.
  
  - `seed` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the transaction chain seed to be able to derive and generate the keys
  - `index` is the number of transactions in the chain, to generate the actual and the next public key (see below the cryptography section)
  - `curve` is the elliptic curve to use for the key generation (can be "ed25519", "P256", "secp256k1") - default o "P256"
  - `hashAlgo` is the hash algorithm to use to generate the address (can be "sha256", "sha512", "sha3-256", "sha3-512", "bake2b") - default to "sha256"
  
  ```js
  const archethic = require('archethic')
  const tx = archethic.newTransactionBuilder("transfer")
    .addUCOTransfer("00b1d3750edb9381c96b1a975a55b5b4e4fb37bfab104c10b0b6c9a00433ec4646", 0.420) 
    .build("mysuperpassphraseorseed", 0) 
  ```

  #### originSign(privateKey)
  Sign the transaction with an origin device private key

   - `privateKey` is hexadecimal encoding or Uint8Array representing the private key to generate the origin signature to able to perform the ProofOfWork and authorize the transaction

  ```js
  const archethic = require('archethic')
  const tx = archethic.newTransactionBuilder("transfer")
    .addUCOTransfer("00b1d3750edb9381c96b1a975a55b5b4e4fb37bfab104c10b0b6c9a00433ec4646", 0.420) 
    .build("mysuperpassphraseorseed", 0) 
    .originSign(originPrivateKey)
  ```

  #### toJSON()
  Export the transaction generated into JSON

   ```js
  const archethic = require('archethic')
  const txJSON = archethic.newTransactionBuilder("transfer")
    .addUCOTransfer("00b1d3750edb9381c96b1a975a55b5b4e4fb37bfab104c10b0b6c9a00433ec4646", 0.420)

  ### Remote Endpoint calls
  #### sendTransaction(tx, endpoint)
  Dispatch  the transaction to a node by serializing a GraphQL request
  
  - `tx` represent the built transaction from the **transactionBuilder**
  - `endpoint` is the HTTP URL to a ArchEthic node (acting as welcome node)

  ```

  #### waitConfirmations(address, endpoint)

  An handler is required which supports the observer design pattern. An replication confirmation will emit the handler function with the new number of replication number.   
  
  ```js
  const archethic = require('archethic')
  tx = ...
  await archethic.sendTransaction(tx, "https://testnet.archethic.net")

  // 0
  ```

  #### getStorageNoncePublicKey(endpoint)

  // 00b1d3750edb9381c96b1a975a55b5b4e4fb37bfab104c10b0b6c9a00433ec4646
  ```

  #### getTransactionFee(tx, endpoint)
  Query a node to fetch the tx fee for a given transaction
  
  - `tx` Generated transaction
  - `endpoint` Node endpoint
  
  ```js
  const archethic = require('archethic')
  const tx = ...
